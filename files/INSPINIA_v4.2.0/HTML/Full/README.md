# INSPINIA - Responsive Bootstrap 5 Admin Dashboard
We would like to thank you for purchasing Inspinia :). The following guideline will help you to get started with the Inspinia and its documentation.

#### Docs and Examples

The `documentation` directory contains all the static resources required for docs and examples. To view, just open in your favorite browser!

#### Gulp

We've included Gulp file (gulpfile.js) to help you get started with the theme and build automation. You'll need to install Node.js and Gulp before using our included gulpfile.js. Note that the detailed instructions are available in `docs/index.html` too.

To install Node visit [https://nodejs.org/download](https://nodejs.org/download/).

To install gulp, run the following command:

```
$ npm install gulp -g
```

When you're done, install the rest of the theme's dependencies:

```
$ yarn install
```

From here on out, simply run `gulp` from your terminal and you're good to go!

+ `gulp` - Recompiles and minifies theme assets into `dist` directory and starts the local server serving the theme.
+ `gulp build` - recompiles and minifies theme assets into `dist` folder.


#### Support

If you experience any problems with the above instruction, or if you think you've found a bug with the theme - please don't hesitate to reach out to https://wrapbootstrap.com/user/WebAppLayers/message
